# Engineering Judgment Log

This file tracks engineering-judgment decisions made *during implementation*
that are **not empirically validated** and are candidates for future
recalibration. It is distinct from the master spec's own frozen /
configurable / open-validation categorization — those are decisions the spec
itself already made. This log is for the narrower, in-code judgment calls
the spec left underdetermined (an unspecified constant, an unset tunable
default) that an implementer had to pick a real number for. It will be added
to as similar judgment calls come up in future phases.

| Decision | Phase | Current Value | Rationale | Validation Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Box-to-point collapse constants (`HEAD_Y_FRACTION`, `HEAD_SCALE_FRACTION`) — `backend/app/pipeline/box_to_point.py` | 6 | `HEAD_Y_FRACTION=0.10`, `HEAD_SCALE_FRACTION=0.13` | Engineering/anthropometric approximation: `HEAD_Y_FRACTION` approximates the head's vertical center rather than the box's raw top edge (which often includes empty margin); `HEAD_SCALE_FRACTION` approximates head height as ~1/7–1/8 of standing body height. | Not peer-reviewed or empirically measured against real footage. Candidate for recalibration once real annotated footage is available. |
| `TRACKER_TRACK_ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD` default — `backend/app/core/config.py` | 7 | `0.3` | Aligns ByteTrack's new-track confirmation floor with `DETECTOR_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`'s 0.25 floor (library's own general-purpose default of 0.7 was found, on real dense-crowd footage, to confirm tracks for almost no one, since most real detections in that footage never exceeded ~0.66 confidence). | Not empirically validated on real crowd footage — a deliberately-chosen value to unblock multi-person tracking, not a tuned one. Candidate for Sprint-0 validation (§35) recalibration, exactly like the master spec's own Crowd Pressure thresholds are documented as open for recalibration. |
| `DIS_PRESET` default — `backend/app/core/config.py` | 8 | `"fast"` | Balance between quality and CPU cost per master spec §5's own citation that DIS runs "~21-48 FPS depending on preset" and is the system's most probable CPU throughput ceiling. | Not empirically validated / benchmarked on this project's target hardware yet. Candidate for Sprint-0 validation (§35) recalibration. |
| `MOTION_MAGNITUDE_NOISE_FLOOR` default — `backend/app/core/config.py` | 8 | `0.5` (pixels) | Dense optical flow on low-texture/static regions produces small, essentially meaningless vectors from compression noise and lighting changes; pixels below this floor are excluded from this phase's whole-frame summary statistics only (never from the raw flow field itself). | Not empirically validated against real footage — a reasonable-sounding round number, not a measured threshold. Candidate for Sprint-0 validation (§35) recalibration. |
